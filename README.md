# RandomMemeGenerator

This app is based on a famous card game called "What do you meme?". In this app, you get a random picture with 4 random sentences,
and you have to choose which sentence fits the best on that picture. After this, your picture gets posted on the main page where
other people can upvote or downvote it. For the funniest pictures, there is a leaderboard.
